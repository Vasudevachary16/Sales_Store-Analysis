# Sales_Store-Analysis
🏬 Store Overview
This project analyzes sales data from a retail store chain that records daily transactions, including product details, customer data, order status, and timing. The goal is to support better decision-making to enhance operations, customer experience, and profitability.

## ⚠️ Problem Statement
The business currently lacks clarity on:
Which products are top sellers
Customer preferences and buying behavior
The most profitable items
Issues in delivery or operational performance
As a result, the store is missing revenue opportunities, losing customer trust, and making uninformed business decisions.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
This project provides clean reports and actionable insights to help the store understand its sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance — enabling smarter, data-driven decisions.
